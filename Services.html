			<h3>Cat Grooming </h3>
				<p>
					That's right, cats need grooming too! While cats may not need grooming as often as dogs it's just as important to meet your cat's needs. As cats age, it often becomes difficult for them to keep up with grooming habbits, which means that a cat groomer is needed. It's best to get fluffy used to being groomed and handled as a kitten so they become comfortable with the process. For more infomation contact our expert cat groomers on how best to serve your kitty.
